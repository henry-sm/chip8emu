#chip8emu

My attempt at learning the basics of emulation by creating a chip8 emulator and I have chosen rust as the language to program in so that i can learn both of them as I go.
Here's to me to be able to complete this project.

Currently it can load up a window, but the input and the display had weird flickers as of now, so those are the current plans for the future.

Relies on `rand` and `minifb` dependencies.
